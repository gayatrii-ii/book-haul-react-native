## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You will also need the **Expo Go** app installed on your physical mobile device.

*   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   [Expo Go (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
*   [Expo Go (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id984021028)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies for both projects.

From the root directory, run:
```bash
# Install root workspace dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && npm install

# Install mobile dependencies
cd ../mobile && npm install
```

### 3. Backend Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:
```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_token
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
```

### 4. Running the Project

You can start both projects from the root workspace directory.

#### Start the Backend:
```bash
npm run backend
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (and connect to your MongoDB database).

#### Start the Mobile Client:
```bash
npm run mobile
```
This launches the Metro Bundler and outputs a QR code.

## 📱 Running on a Physical Phone (Expo Go)

1.  Ensure both your computer and your phone are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.
2.  Open **`mobile/src/constants/api.js`** and verify the `API_URL` is set to your computer's local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.X.X:3000/api`).
3.  Scan the QR code shown in your terminal:
    *   **Android**: Scan using the **Expo Go** app.
    *   **iOS**: Scan using your iPhone's built-in **Camera** app and tap the prompt to open in Expo Go.
